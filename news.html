        <p>
          TA: NE V1.5 is getting nearer every day - Here is what to expect from it! <br>
          Soon The Adventure: New Eden will celebrate getting halfway to V2.0 but what can we expect from V1.5 - Will it be good <br>
          or bad? We can only make assumtions at this point but a few of the listed items are guaranteed to make it in: <br>
          -Lots and lots of bug fixes <br>
          -Possibly a new dimension <br>
          -Settings/Loading Screen <br>
          -Pause Menu <br>
          As I said we can only make assumtions so not all of these are guaranteed to get in but this data is based off <br>
          previous TA: NE Update History so at least some will make it in.
